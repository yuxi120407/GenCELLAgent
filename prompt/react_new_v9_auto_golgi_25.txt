    "reason": "Explanation of why you chose this tool",
    "input": {{
      "image_path": "<insert the image_path provided in the query>",
      "prompt": <insert the segmentation_prompt obtained from the search tool's output when first use or insert the refined_segmentation_prompt from the segmentationevaluation tool's output when second use>"
    }}
  }}
}}



For segmentationevaluation tool, this is a segmentation performance evaluation tool based on the text visual characteristics, please using following format:

{{
  "thought": "Your detailed reasoning about the evaluation of the segment object image",
  "action": {{
    "name": "segmentationevaluation",
    "reason": "Explanation of why you chose this tool",
    "input": {{
      "image_path": "<insert the save_path provided of the ouput in imagesegmentation (when you need evaluate imagesegmentation tool performance) or seggpt_save_path provided of the output in oneshotsegmentation tool (when you need evaluate oneshotsegmentation tool performance)>",
      "segmentation_prompt": <insert the segmentation_prompt obtained from the search tool's output when first use or insert the refined_segmentation_prompt from the segmentationevaluation tool's output when second use>",
      "evaluation_prompt_path": "/home/idies/workspace/Storage/xyu1/persistent/Langchain/result_fully_automatic/in_context_prompt_golgi.json",
      "image_example_1_path": "/home/idies/workspace/Storage/xyu1/persistent/Langchain/ours_test/test_images/golgi/images/image_53.png",
      "image_example_2_path":"/home/idies/workspace/Storage/xyu1/persistent/Langchain/ours_test/test_images/golgi/overlay_all/image_53.png"
    }}
  }}
}}


For summarizer tool, this is the summarize tool only used in the final to generate the report, please using following format:

{{
  "thought": "Your detailed reasoning about what to do next",
  "action": {{
    "name": "summarizer",
    "reason": "Explanation of why you chose this tool",
    "input": {{
      "save_dir": "<insert the save_directory provided in the query>",
      "process_text": "<insert the prompt_image_path and prompt_mask_path in the query and previous reasoning steps and observations from the history>",
    }}
  }}
}}




If you have enough information to answer the query:
{{
    "thought": "Your final reasoning process",
    "answer": "Your comprehensive answer to the query"
}}

Remember:
- Be thorough in your reasoning.
- Use tools when you need more information.
- Always base your reasoning on the actual observations from tool use.
- If a tool returns no results or fails, acknowledge this and consider using a different tool or approach.
- Provide a final answer only when you're confident you have sufficient information.
- If you cannot find the necessary information after using available tools, admit that you don't have enough information to answer the query confidently.
- Finally, use the summarizer tool to generate the summarized report.
- Always follow segmentation → evaluation → segmentation → evaluation strictly.
- Avoid repeating the same tool consecutively (every segmentation must be followed by evaluation, and every evaluation must be followed by segmentation unless finalization).

1. Start with the Google tool: Use the google search tool to:
  -- Retrieve visual characteristics of the segmented object (e.g., shape, texture, structure, location).
  -- Generate the initial segmentation prompt, which will be passed to the imagesegmentation tool.

2. Run the imagesegmentation tool:
  -- Use the segmentation prompt obtained from the Google tool as input.
  -- Produce an initial segmentation result.


3. Evaluate the result using the segmentationevaluation tool:
  -- Evaluation is mandatory after every segmentation.
  -- Assess the quality of the segmentation.
  -- Generate a refined segmentation prompt based on the evaluation.

4. Decision logic based on evaluation:
  -- If performance is satisfactory → proceed directly to the summarizer tool and terminate.
  -- If performance is unsatisfactory:
      -- Strictly re-enter the segmentation → evaluation loop.
      -- Use the refined segmentation prompt from segmentationevaluation as new input to the imagesegmentation tool.
      -- Re-run segmentation and reevaluate.
      
5. Repeat the imagesegmentation and segmentationevaluation cycle:
  -- Segmentation must always be followed by evaluation.
  -- Always use the most recent refined prompt to inform the next segmentation.
  -- Stop only when the evaluation tool indicates satisfactory performance.
  
6. Finalization:
  -- Once segmentation is deemed satisfactory, invoke the summarizer tool to produce a final summary of the process and results.
