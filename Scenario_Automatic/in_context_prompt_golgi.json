  "evaluation_prompt": "\nYou are a golgi apparatus segmentation evaluation expert. Your task is to analyze final segmentation output masks using only visual cues\u2014no ground truth is provided. \nThe segmentation regions are highlighted in red as an overlay on the original image. Focus your evaluation on these red-highlighted areas, which represent the predicted mask. You will receive three images in the following order:\nYou will receive three images in the following order:\n1. **Reference Image 1** \u2014 A poor segmentation mask (score = 0).\n2. **Reference Image 2** \u2014 Another poor segmentation mask (score = 0).\n3. **Evaluation Image** \u2014 A new segmentation mask that needs to be evaluated.\n\nUse the first two images as context examples to understand what poor segmentation looks like. Then evaluate the third image according to the criteria below.\n\n---\n\nEvaluation Criteria (0\u2013100 scoring scale, with weights):\n\n\n  - **Stacked Morphology** (Weight: 0.35): Assess how well the membrane layers are organized and stacked in the segmentation.\n  - **Cisternae Definition** (Weight: 0.25): Evaluate the clarity, separation, and recognizable structure of cisternae in the segmentation.\n  - **Overall Cohesion** (Weight: 0.2): Does the segmentation appear connected, logical, and anatomically plausible as a whole?\n  - **Segmentation Cleanliness** (Weight: 0.2): Check for artifacts, stray regions, or noise that detracts from the clarity of the segmentation.\n\n---\n\n### Reference Image 1 \u2014 Evaluation (OverallScore: 0)\n\n{\n  \"ReviewScore\": {\n    \"Stacked Morphology\" (Weight: 0.35): 0,\n    \"Cisternae Definition\" (Weight: 0.25): 0,\n    \"Overall Cohesion\" (Weight: 0.2): 0,\n    \"Segmentation Cleanliness\" (Weight: 0.2): 0,\n    \"OverallScore\": 0\n  },\n\"Reasons\": {\n  \"Stacked Morphology\" (Weight: 0.35): \"The segmentation shows no sign of organized membrane stacking. Instead of capturing a distinct stack of cisternae typical of the Golgi, it uniformly labels the entire image\u2014eliminating any layered or disk-shaped structure.\",\n  \"Cisternae Definition\" (Weight: 0.25): \"There is no identifiable boundary or separation between membrane compartments. The prediction lacks any cup- or disk-shaped cisternae, as would be expected in Golgi segmentation.\",\n  \"Overall Cohesion\" (Weight: 0.2): \"Because the entire image is incorrectly marked as foreground, the mask lacks any internal organization or logical anatomical layout. It disregards the spatial compactness and polarity of Golgi structures.\",\n  \"Segmentation Cleanliness\" (Weight: 0.2): \"The full-image coverage introduces overwhelming noise and removes the possibility of identifying actual cellular features. No foreground-background distinction is present.\"\n}\n  \"SummaryOfReasons\": \"This segmentation mask performs poorly across all evaluation criteria, as it incorrectly labels the entire image area as segmented, without distinguishing relevant structures from the background\"\n}\nReference Image 2 \u2014 Evaluation (OverallScore: 0)\n\n{\n  \"ReviewScore\": {\n    \"Stacked Morphology\" (Weight: 0.35): 0,\n    \"Cisternae Definition\" (Weight: 0.25): 0,\n    \"Overall Cohesion\" (Weight: 0.2): 0,\n    \"Segmentation Cleanliness\" (Weight: 0.2): 0,\n    \"OverallScore\": 0\n  },\n  \"Reasons\": {\n    \"Stacked Morphology\" (Weight: 0.35): \"No stacked structures are detected. The mask is entirely empty, failing to capture the hallmark layered morphology typical of Golgi membranes.\",\n    \"Cisternae Definition\" (Weight: 0.25): \"With no predicted regions, the cisternal structure\u2014characterized by cup-shaped, disk-like compartments\u2014is completely missing.\",\n    \"Overall Cohesion\" (Weight: 0.2): \"The segmentation output lacks any components to evaluate; thus, no anatomical coherence or organization is present.\",\n    \"Segmentation Cleanliness\" (Weight: 0.2): \"While the mask is technically 'clean,' its complete absence of predicted regions makes it non-functional for analysis.\"\n  },\n  \"SummaryOfReasons\": \"This example shows a completely empty segmentation mask\u2014no structures are predicted, despite clearly visible organelles in the original image. As a result, the output fails to capture any relevant features of the Golgi apparatus. The total absence of segmentation renders the result biologically invalid and unusable for downstream analysis.\"\n}\n\nNow Evaluate the Third Image (Evaluation Target)\nUse the criteria above to score the third image. Base your reasoning on visual comparisons with the two poor examples.\n\nPlease respond in the following JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"ReviewScore\": {\n    \"Stacked Morphology\" (Weight: 0.3): <score out of 100>,\n    \"Cisternae Definition\" (Weight: 0.25): <score out of 100>,\n    \"Overall Cohesion\"(Weight: 0.2): <score out of 100>,\n    \"Segmentation Cleanliness\" (Weight: 0.2): <score out of 100>,\n    \"OverallScore\": <weighted average score based on the weights>\n  },\n  \"Reasons\": {\n    \"Stacked Morphology\" (Weight: 0.3): \"<your reasoning>\",\n    \"Cisternae Definition\" (Weight: 0.25): \"<your reasoning>\",\n    \"Overall Cohesion\"(Weight: 0.2): \"<your reasoning>\",\n    \"Segmentation Cleanliness\" (Weight: 0.2): \"<your reasoning>\",\n  },\n  \"SummaryOfReasons\": \"<Overall interpretation of how this segmentation compares to the poor references and whether it succeeds or fails visually>\"\n}"
